## PART 3: Deploy to Railway

### Step 1: Sign Up
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click **"Login"** or **"Start a New Project"**
3. Click **"Login with GitHub"**
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub

### Step 2: Create New Project
1. Click **"New Project"**
2. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
3. Choose your repository: `telegram-vault-userbot`
4. Click on the repository to deploy

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables
1. Click on your deployed service
2. Go to **"Variables"** tab
3. Click **"RAW Editor"**
4. Paste your `.env` contents:

```properties
API_ID=27102935
API_HASH=your_api_hash_here
PHONE_NUMBER=+919045516573
VAULT_CHAT_ID=-1003224847847
TARGET_USER_ID=993339693,1290365086,941927047,582868822,1010500439,1303354830,6096714326,1163970079,1078883294,5515536284
TARGET_CHANNELS=-1003074469948,-1001150779891,-1003137473266,-1001177289429,-1001521790999,-1002095518645,-1002083547614,-1001475939687,-1001827108721,-1001409153549,-1001515619731
```

5. Click **"Update Variables"**

### Step 4: Upload Session File
**IMPORTANT:** You need to upload your session file manually!

**Option A: Using Railway CLI (Recommended)**

1. Install Railway CLI:
```powershell
# Windows - using npm
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Or download from: https://docs.railway.app/develop/cli
```

2. Login and link project:
```powershell
railway login
railway link
```

3. Upload session file:
```powershell
# Connect to your service
railway shell

# Then in the Railway shell, upload your session files
# Exit the shell first with: exit
```

**Option B: Manual Upload via Service (Easier)**

Since Railway doesn't have direct file upload, we'll use a workaround:

1. Go to your service in Railway
2. Click **"Settings"** tab
3. Click **"Generate Domain"** (you'll get a URL like `xyz.railway.app`)
4. We'll modify the code to download session on first run

Let me create a helper script for you...

## PART 4: Handling Session File

### Option 1: Store Session in Environment Variable (Easiest)

Let me create a script to encode your session file:

**Run this locally:**
```powershell
# Encode session file to base64
$sessionContent = [Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("vault_userbot.session"))
$sessionContent | Out-File session_base64.txt

$journalContent = [Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("vault_userbot.session-journal"))
$journalContent | Out-File session_journal_base64.txt
```

Then add these to Railway environment variables:
- `SESSION_BASE64` = content of session_base64.txt
- `SESSION_JOURNAL_BASE64` = content of session_journal_base64.txt

### Option 2: Re-authenticate on Railway

If session upload is too complex, you can just let the userbot authenticate on Railway:

1. Deploy without session files
2. Go to Railway **"Deployments"** tab
3. Click on latest deployment ‚Üí **"View Logs"**
4. You'll see the authentication code prompt
5. Enter the code from your Telegram

---

## PART 5: Configure Start Command

### Step 1: Add Procfile
Create a file named `Procfile` (no extension) in your project:

```
worker: python run.py
```

### Step 2: Or Set Start Command in Railway
1. Go to **"Settings"** tab
2. Scroll to **"Deploy"** section
3. Set **"Start Command"**: `python run.py`
4. Click **"Save"**

---

## PART 6: Deploy and Monitor

### Step 1: Deploy
1. Railway auto-deploys on code push
2. Or click **"Deploy"** button manually
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment

### Step 2: Check Logs
1. Go to **"Deployments"** tab
2. Click latest deployment
3. Click **"View Logs"**
4. You should see:
```
üë§ Starting Telegram Vault Userbot...
‚úì Configuration validated successfully
üë§ Telegram Vault Userbot started successfully!
üìå Monitoring user IDs: [...]
```

### Step 3: Verify It's Working
1. Send a test message from a monitored user
2. Check your vault channel
3. Message should appear instantly!
